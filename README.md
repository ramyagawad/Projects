Requirements
This program will be a C# Console Application called RockPaperScissors.

- The program first asks the user how many rounds he/she wants to play.
    - Maximum number of rounds = 10, minimum number of rounds = 1. If the user asks for something       outside this range, the program prints an error message and quits.
    - If the number of rounds is in range, the program plays that number of rounds. Each round is       played according to the requirements below.
    
- For each round of Rock, Paper, Scissors, the program does the following:
    - The computer asks the user for his/her choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
        - Hint: 1 = Rock, 2 = Paper, 3 = Scissors
    - After the computer asks for the user's input, the computer randomly chooses Rock, Paper, or       Scissors and displays the result of the round (tie, user win, or computer win).
       - Hint: use the Random class.
- The program must keep track of how many rounds are ties, user wins, or computer wins.
        - Hint: Create three variables to keep track of these items and update them correctly               after each round.
- The program must print out the number of ties, user wins, and computer wins and declare the         overall winner based on who won more rounds.
- After all rounds have been played and the winner declared, the program must ask the user if         he/she wants to play again.
      - If the user says No, the program prints out a message saying, “Thanks for playing!” and           then exits.
       - If the user says Yes, the program starts over, asking the user how many rounds he/she            would like to play
