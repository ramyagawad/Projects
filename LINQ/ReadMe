LINQ Query Writing
Overview
Project source code: LINQExercises.zip

This assessment gives you an opportunity to work with sample data organized into collections that you will write LINQ queries against. The downloaded solution file contains a Program.cs file that contains a list of exercise methods with summary comments that describe the data that should be outputted.

In each method, you may retrieve the appropriate sample data from the DataLoader class. This class contains a few public members that will be referenced by the exercises:

Member	Description
LoadProducts()	Loads the products sample data set.
LoadCustomers()	Loads the customers sample data set.
NumbersA	An integer array of numbers
NumbersB	An integer array of numbers
