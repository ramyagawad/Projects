Write a console application named SummativeSums. It must include a static method that takes in an array of ints, adds them together, and returns the result.

Call your new method inside a main method and print out the result for the following three example arrays:

{ 1, 90, -33, -55, 67, -16, 28, -55, 15 }
{ 999, -60, -77, 14, 160, 301 }
{ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 
140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, -99 }
